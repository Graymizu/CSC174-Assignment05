			<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					Hi, name is Anthony and I'm a senior at the University of Rochester. I belive my time at college has been largely shaped by the clubs that I've joined and material that I've studied. I currently hold the Business Manager Eboard position for RICE Crew, and I was on the Hospitality Team for ACF during my junior year.
