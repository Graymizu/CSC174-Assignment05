				I am currently a senior at the University of Rochester, Class of 2018. I am majoring in <em>Digitial Media Studies</em> and <em>Creative writing</em>. I enjoy creating things that look cool to me, which is esentially things that look good to my design aesthetic.  I'm a pretty big fan of Sci-Fi, whether it be ultra-modern or cyberpunk, and I think that the former influences my personal aesthetics more than a little.
