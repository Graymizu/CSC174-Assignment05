			<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					Hello! My name is Lulu and I am a third year at the University of Rochester. Currently, I am working on a independent study at the Saunders Research Building located at the hospital. I have experience as a field worker with people of disabilities. I am pursuing a minor in Computer Science because it will be beneficial for my future. I used to be a Graphic Design Major and still love to play around with code and formatting during my free time.

				<h3>My Role</h3>
					<p>
						As a academic coach I audit a course with a student in TOUR and we take a college course together. I also meet with them outside of class time for a hour or so every week to help them keep up in the class. As a coach, my primary job is to help my mentee reach the goal that they want for the particular class they are taking. 
					</p>

			<h2>Graphic Design</h2>

				<p>
					I transferred to the University of Rochester in the year of 2014. However, during my time at my other college, I took a couple of Graphic Design courses and fell in love with it. We did not code much, but we played around with formatting and 3D design.
